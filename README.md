# LSky Dynamic Skydome for Unity Engine.
-------------
- This system is being built based on my previous assets LSky v3.0 and CSky, but looking for it to be more solid.
- I will support this asset in my spare time, until 2019.3 is available, since I will be using it for prototypes while I build a more complex system.

- If there is an error, there will be a new issue.
